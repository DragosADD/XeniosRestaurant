This application has the purpose of managing orders and menus for a restaurant. Client accounts are designed for ordering and keeping track of placed orders, while Admin accounts are responsible for updating the menu, monitoring orders, and changing their status. 

There is also a priority feature that members can pay for and on the admin's side it is shown what order needs to be processed first.(last thing to do)


In order to test the aplication you will need node.js in order to use npm.
The only commands needed ( "npm i" and you can also use "npm run dev") 

Feel are free to create an account, validation by email is turned off.
At the moment only one account is able to log in as admin, please use the following:

email: karl@admin.com
password: interestingpassword

There are some photos of the aplication in the current stage in the folder "photos", only the priority managing is left to be implemented.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
